# Maze Life-like cellular automaton

**Maze** is a Life-like cellular automaton which arises by slightly modyfing Conway's Game of Life rules to keep cells alive.
The structures this automaton creates are maze-like structures which sometimes evolve in corridors (see https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:Maze)

This Python script creates an animated gif which shows the evolution of this kind of automaton on a 200x200 grid.
The first pass just run on an f-pentamino resting on a vertical index of 100.

**How to run this script** 

 1. Install the requirements from requirements.txt
 2. Run *python maze_cellular_automata.py*
 3. Watch how the automaton evolves by opening maze.gif
